    <!-- How do you make sense of all the user stories? How will you group, refine, and score them?

Make your own personal copy of the analysis document started by your group. Apply a scoring algorithm of 
some kind, or use whatever methods you prefer to identify which stories you MUST address, which you would LIKE to address, and which you can probably dismiss. -->

    <h2>Scoring Criteria</h2>
    <p>Our group grouped each user's need based on how important it is to them and in general sense. We have Goals, Website features, Actoin feature for grouping. 
        The scording is consist of 7 parameters and each of the group member scored these parameters (needs) based on our interpretions and the user's needs in the grouping 
        stage. I think we must address the teen's needs and the senior's needs since they represent a wide range of people and their needs exand from accessibility to efficiency.
