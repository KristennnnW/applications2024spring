    <h2>LARQ: Around 300ml White Thermo (better on sale)</h2>
    <a href="https://www.livelarq.com/">link</a>
    <ul>
        <li>Header bar and select drink ware directly, ignore the cover image on home page</li>
        <li>Scroll to see items in a general sense, focusing on rectangle pictures of bottles</li>
        <li>Select color on the widget of the picture the bottle to see the colored mock up; I know this follows the convention because it uses a square selection box on the thumbnails at the bottom of each image container</li>
        <li>Check the capacity on the rhs, convert oz to ml in an external website</li>
        <li>Scroll down the detail page to see the bottle in all directions</li>
        <li>Check the boxes of reviews and FAQ by scrolling further down (almost miss this part)</li>
        <li>Check adds on items by clicking in the box. I know this is clickable because there is a hover effect </li>
        <li>Pop up window component for me to check out and view my shopping cart easily, I think this is a great feature to let the user to double check their adding. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Microcenter: 32 inch 4k monitor</h2>
    <a href="https://www.microcenter.com">link</a>
    <p>The menu bar is the first place I go to and the following subtitles.  I found 4k monitor directly without manually entering anything. I use the filter section on the left to filter 32’’ since I did not see any 32’’ monitor when skimming the options pop out. Since I know little about monitors I sort the results by rating and click into the first product. I check the overview of what this monitor is suitable for and manually check the size compared to my laptop to see if it will fit in my desk. The scrollable page turner feature is very useful since it allows me to see the product in all directions as I’m seeing it in person. After I added it to the cart, insurance and ‘often bought with’ section pop up along with the add confirmation which is very convenient. </p>

    <h2>Black Sheep: Long board ready-to-use skateboard</h2>
    <a href="https://blacksheepskateshop.com/collections/completes">link</a>
    <p>I go to the menu bar and select complete. There is no size filter so I need to check the size manually and selected a one with greater length to start with. In the detail page there is no review section and only a brief description and material list. I have no previous knowledge of skateboar and I wonder if the board is for beginners or pros. The image also only have a general look and no close up for the wheels. When I click on the add to cart, the page will automatically jump to the check out page without giving me any chance to look and see other similar products or ‘buy together’ products. 
    </p>

    <h2>Total wine: 750ml Scotch Whiskey under $50</h2>
    <a href="https://www.totalwine.com">link</a>
    <p>I go to the horizontal scroll bar directly for different alcohol genres there and select Scotch. I looked at the marked volume on the products in this section and select a Limited Time Special. I like the part that in addition to the overview of the wine (e.g. brand, country…), there is also a section for Product Highlight with the tags highlighting the keywords in the paragraph so that I don’t have to spend time reading. In the product detail there is also a ‘progress bar’ showing the range of mild-complex and delicate-rich which is great for people with little knowledge of this type of whiskey. Food pairing is shown with pictures and names of food. A table is used to compare similar products.

    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>For viewing the genre of items, a horizontal header menu is very common and the following popup sub-titles. A scrollable page turner is universal for seeing products in different directions and for more details. There are also filter options and sort function next to the search bar or on the side. A pop up window for shopping cart confirmation and similar products is also very common. In the detail page, separate pages for different content (e.g. overview, size chart)  indicated by tabs on the top seem universal. The progress bar in the wine website is very uncommon and can only be used to indicate the level or degree. I was most unsatisfied with the skateboard website since I’m looking for long complete skateboards, but there is only filter for complete ones but no selection for size. In the detail page, I was also expecting to see the details of each part but they only provide pictures of the product in an overall look. I wish there is a close up picture or allow the users to zoom in/out. Some of the website have automatic unit switching (inch to cm) and I think it is a great feature to improve the equity.
