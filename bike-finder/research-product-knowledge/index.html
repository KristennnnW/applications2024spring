    <h1>Research</h1>
    <h2>Trek Bike</h2>

    <p>I was looking for a bike for long-distance travel on mountains. I played the role as a beginner who has limited knowledge about bike features and settings. When I click the ‘mountain’ option on the menu, a list of unfamiliar bike terms pop up with no explanation. There is a function ‘help me choose’ which is designed perfectly or beginners by letting them input their desired features by asking easy questions. The features introduced by the product detail includes overview, features, specs, sizing, geometry, service, and reviews. In the overview it specifies why it fits my needs. There is ‘add to compare’ option in addition to shopping cart but nowhere to explain how the function is used. </p>

    <p>I’m looking for kid’s bike (kid around 10) for this website. The description has emphasized on the materials. It also has a section for suggested rider height in stead of age. The product has marked with the percentage off and I chose the one with the biggest discount. </p>

    <h2>REI</h2>
    <a href="https://www.rei.com/stores/st-louis/bike-shop?r=stores%3A73">link</a>
    <p>The bike category is more general compared to Trek Bike with only the purpose of the bike such as “road” and “mountain”. It has specifies the type of road this bicycle is suitable for in the introduction on the detail page. Compared to bike-only websites, there are fewer bike terms here and only sections of feature, specs, size chart, and reviews. Most of the information is about the sports store. </p>

    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>A big question a buyer will be faced with is if this the right bike for them and will it meet their requirements. They will check the descriptions for the bike specification, features, size and reviews. 
        Their priorities would be if the quality of the bike matches the price and if the bike can be built at home or needs to be built in a professional bike store. I did not understand why there are multiple pages of material and geometry for the bike, and now I understand it is different from other products we usually purchase online. Users want to know the specific details of the bike data to better suit their needs, especially the enthusiasts or pros. </p>
